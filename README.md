**Compressed Sensing Image Recovery**

The goal of this project was to create an algorithm which restores an image with corrupted/missing pixels, by
using LASSO regression and random subsets cross validation to estimate the pixel color for black and white images.
The Jupyter notebook file contains all of the code used as well as comments explaining each section.
